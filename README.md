Graceful degredation is the practice of building a website so that it works with all the latest features of modern browsers and systems, but it still provides core functionality when things go wrong, even if the product is not as good. Service workers relate to this because they enable offline capabilities by caching resources and intercepting network requests to still provide content when the network is unavailable. This ensures that even if certain functionalities or connections fail, the user can still access essential parts of the application, thus maintaining a usable experience.
